## Notes

Got stuck because of lacking python knowledge. Passed Objects to functions return back with changed values if manupulated,
got therefore some problems because of manupulating the values inside the recursicve functions, and also at Part2 because
the data was already changed in Part1, therefore the input was not the initial dataset
