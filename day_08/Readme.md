### Question

Because the digits 1, 4, 7, and 8 each use a unique number of segments, you should be able to tell which combinations of signals correspond to those digits. Counting only digits in the output values (the part after | on each line), in the above example, there are 26 instances of digits that use a unique number of segments (highlighted above).

In the output values, how many times do digits 1, 4, 7, or 8 appear?

### Answer

Check Python script: [day08.py](./day08.py)

## Notes

Larger Example Set with Unit Tests implementation was very helpful to implement every possible compination.
Maybee there is an easier way with pattern detection but it's performant and it works
