### Question

To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - a total of 5 points.

Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

### Answer

Check Python script: [day05.py](./day05.py)

## Notes

Already inmplemented diagonal lines for Part1, so read the answers and hints carefully.

Get some major help from my little daughter, she draws the sample on a squared paper,
and joined me while I implemented the different steps, maybee a little programmer for the future ;-)
